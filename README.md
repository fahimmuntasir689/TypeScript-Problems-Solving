## How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.Meaning TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.Basically it shares the same base syntax as JavaScript, but adds something to it.It helps developers in improving code quality as well as project maintainability.How it does so are given below.

1. Typing : In javascript we don't have to use type or no need to mention type.But in TypeScript we have to use type strictly.TypeScript prevents incorrect usage before it becomes a runtime bug.
