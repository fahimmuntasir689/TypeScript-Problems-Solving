## How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.Meaning TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.Basically it shares the same base syntax as JavaScript, but adds something to it.It helps developers in improving code quality as well as project maintainability.How it does so are given below.

1. Typing : In javascript we don't have to use type or no need to mention type.But in TypeScript we have to use type strictly.TypeScript prevents incorrect usage before it becomes a runtime bug.


2.Code Completion & IntelliSense : In javascript we have Limited autocompletion, no validation on parameter types.On the contrary TypeScript autocomplete on function names, parameters, interfaces, enums, etc.It helps us to write faster, with fewer mistakes which makes us more productive and assist for less error-codes.



3.Scalability ; TypeScript scales with your project, enforcing structure and safety.On the otherside JavaScript works fine for small scripts but becomes messy and seems unorganaized as the codebase grows.
